Why should my lack of wanting be treated as a deficiency if it comes with a profound sense of sufficiency?

Why should my lack of wanting be treated as a deficiency if it comes with a profound sense of sufficiency? The trouble seems to arise only when I begin to compare myself to others or when I begin to want what I do not have. It is only at that threshold, when lack intrudes upon contentment, that restlessness and with it suffering, begins.

This question, however, is more complex than it first appears. Human traditions have long wrestled with the paradox of desire. Is desire the fire that drives growth or the chain that binds us to perpetual dissatisfaction? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stoics</a> taught that true freedom lies in limiting one’s wants to what lies within one’s control. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buddhism</a>, in its most well-known teaching, identified craving as the root of suffering. And yet, to reduce this entire discussion to the dichotomy of East and West or to figures like Buddha and Socrates, would be to overlook a profound and deeply textured tradition within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islamic philosophy</a>, where thinkers sought not only to critique desire but to map its anatomy.

Among these thinkers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Al-Ghazali</a> stands out. For Al-Ghazali, the problem was never simply desire itself, but its origin and its destination. Where does my longing arise from? Toward what end does it pull me? Desire can be a ladder to transcendence or a pit that swallows us whole. The issue, then, is not to kill desire but to purify it, to transmute its energy so it ceases to serve the lower self and begins to serve the higher.

Consider, the famous encounter between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander the Great</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diogenes the Cynic</a>. On the one hand stands Alexander, embodiment of conquest, power and restless striving. He personifies what Islamic thought would call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nafs al-ammārah</a>, the commanding soul, driven by appetite and ambition without restraint. On the other hand sits Diogenes, dwelling in his barrel, embodying radical detachment from society’s norms and possessions. To many, his life appeared absurd; to him, it was freedom.

When Alexander, in his grandeur, offered to grant Diogenes any wish, Diogenes simply replied: “Stand out of my sunlight.” At first glance, this seems like a witty dismissal. But looked at more closely, it is a philosophical declaration. All of Alexander’s treasures are powerless compared to the simple gift of sunlight and the sovereign freedom of not needing anything more.

The story takes an even deeper turn when we consider Alexander’s response: “If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.” His words are not merely admiration but a recognition of something essential, what Islamic philosophy calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitrah</a>, the innate and primordial nature with which every soul is created. Alexander, at the peak of worldly power, intuits the hollowness of excess and glimpses the purity of a soul unburdened.

Thinkers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ibn Sina (Avicenna)</a> took such stories not as curiosities but as windows into the spectrum of the soul. For him, Alexander and Diogenes are not two options to be chosen between, but two poles on a continuum of possibility. The task of the human being is not to side with one extreme or carve out a lazy compromise, but to undergo a process of transformation. This process is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazkiah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tazkiyah</a>, purification of the self, by which raw desire is refined into its truest form. The guiding question, then, is not “How much should I desire?” but “What is the nature of my desire and does it align with my highest self?”

It is here that the notion of low desire becomes more nuanced. For Islamic thinkers, low desire is not in itself good or bad. It must be diagnosed. Early spiritual masters like Al-Muhasibi placed enormous emphasis on muhasaba, the inner audit of one’s intentions and actions. Through this lens, a state of diminished wanting can signify either the pinnacle of spiritual achievement or the depths of spiritual collapse.

For some, low desire reflects Qanā‘ah or contentment. This is not passive apathy but an active, mature serenity. It is the fruit of struggle, the calm after wrestling with the self and with the illusions of the world. The person of Qanā‘ah is like Diogenes in his barrel, but with a crucial difference. Their peace is not a philosophical posture but a spiritual victory. They have not merely renounced; they have reconciled. They rest in the decree of God, their heart unperturbed. To demand more desire from such a soul is to misunderstand them entirely; their quiet is not emptiness but fullness.

For others, however, low desire signals a very different reality. It may arise from kasal (sloth), jubn (cowardice) or sheer despair. This is the artist who never paints, not because she has transcended ambition but because she fears failure. This is the would-be leader who never speaks, not out of humility but out of self-doubt. Here, low desire is a prison. The Persian poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumi</a> warns against this false quiet. It is not peace but betrayal, the silencing of the soul’s call. In such a state, the soul suffers not because it craves too much, but because it denies its own God-given potential, its Fitrah.

The contrast is striking. Two people may appear equally unambitious, equally detached, equally at rest. Yet one has climbed the mountain of the self and arrived at serenity, while the other has fled the climb altogether. One silence is victory; the other is avoidance. One is like the quiet after a just war is won. The other is like the stillness of a desert that has turned away the rain.

So, is low desire a problem? Islamic philosophy resists the simplicity of a yes or no. It offers instead a mirror, a diagnostic tool, an invitation to radical honesty. The questions it poses are:

- Is my lack of desire the fruit of Qanā‘ah or the rot of kasal?

- Has my soul subdued the nafs al-ammārah in service of a higher purpose or has it simply gone numb?

- Am I aligned with my highest nature or am I betraying it?

The conclusion is subtle yet profound. The problem is never the quantity of desire but its quality and orientation. Desire is like water. In one form, it nourishes, purifies and sustains life. In another, it floods, drowns and destroys. The task is not to drain the river but to channel it.

Thus, the question of desire becomes not merely psychological but spiritual. The challenge is to discern which quiet we are living in; is it the quiet of fulfillment or the quiet of neglect.`,

    content: `Mathematics is not a cold kingdom of eternal truths set apart from the world. It is a living river, flowing through cultures, carrying with it the sediments of survival and the light of transcendence. Ubiratan D’Ambrosio calls this current ethnomathematics, for mathematics is always shaped by the human hand, always marked by the earth from which it springs. The ethno gives us the soil and the sky, the mathema gives us that which is learned and the tics gives us the techniques by which we survive and dream. In this view, mathematics is not a ladder dropped from heaven but a rope we weave ourselves, strand by strand, to climb beyond our limits.

At its dawn, mathematics was a matter of necessity. The shepherd who placed a stone for every sheep was already discovering bijection, though he had no name for it. His practice embodies the truth that a function $f: S \\to P$ may be injective and surjective, a pairing where nothing is lost and nothing is left unmatched. In time, the act of counting became number itself and from number, arithmetic was born. Peano would later capture this in axioms such that zero is a number, each number has a successor and addition arises by recursion, $m + 0 = m$, $m + S(n) = S(m+n)$. What began with sheep and stones has become a pure, infinite ladder, climbing ever upward, rung by rung.

Cultures across the earth gave different voices to this truth. The Babylonians wrote in base sixty, the Mayans in base twenty, the Romans in rigid numerals. In the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, Al-Khwarizmi gave birth to algebra. He named it al-jabr, the art of restoration, balancing what is unknown until it is revealed. To solve $x^2 + 10x = 39$, he completed the square: $x^2 + 10x + 25 = 64$, so that $x + 5 = 8$ and $x = 3$. What began as a method of solving practical problems has become a universal language of relations. His algorithms, with his very name giving us the word, seeded the logic of the machines that now hum in every corner of our lives. And his introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numerals and zero was a revolution beyond reckoning, for zero allowed us to not only count but to imagine the void as number, the infinite as countable.

Geometry, too, was carried forward in these lands. Omar Khayyam, both poet and mathematician, sought to untangle Euclid’s parallel postulate, long a thorn in the side of geometry. He studied its hidden structure and in doing so touched the very threshold of non-Euclidean spaces centuries before Bolyai or Lobachevsky. Khayyam also solved cubic equations using conic sections, drawing a parabola and a circle whose intersection revealed the solution. The equation $x^3 + 200x = 20x^2 + 2000$ was not abstract to him but a curve in space, its truth discovered where shapes meet. He saw algebra and geometry as two halves of one harmony, much as his poetry saw the earthly and the eternal as two reflections of the same light.

Other voices carried the story further. Al-Kindi, philosopher of the Arabs, spoke of numbers as keys to the harmony of the cosmos, a music heard not with the ears but with the intellect. Ibn Sina, physician and metaphysician, wove logic and mathematics into his vision of being itself, treating number and magnitude as the scaffolding upon which the edifice of knowledge must rise. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, working in Maragha, refined Euclidean geometry and studied the motion of planets, creating the Tusi couple, a geometric construction that generates linear motion from two circles. Centuries later, this very device appeared in Copernicus’ De Revolutionibus, a quiet testament to the transmission of ideas across cultures. Ibn al-Haytham, in his Book of Optics, treated light not only as a physical phenomenon but as a problem in geometry and algebra. His method of controlled experimentation and his analyses of reflection and refraction carried the seeds of what we now call the scientific method. For him, geometry was not only the measure of space but the language of vision itself.

The rhythm of survival and transcendence beat again in the invention of calculus. Newton and Leibniz, grappling with the mystery of motion, invoked infinitesimals, quantities smaller than any number yet greater than zero. They were ghosts, but ghosts with power. Berkeley mocked them as phantoms, but planets traced their orbits under their spell. It was Cauchy and Weierstrass who gave them clarity, defining limits with precision. To say $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L$ is to bind the elusive word “approaches” with the language of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. For every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that whenever $|x-a| < \\delta$, then $|f(x)-L| < \\epsilon$. From this, the derivative and the integral arise, rigorous, unshakable, yet still rooted in that ancient desire to capture change itself.

And yet, mathematics also encounters its own horizons. In the twentieth century, Gödel showed that any system rich enough to contain arithmetic will harbor truths it cannot prove. His theorems revealed mathematics to be inexhaustible, forever incomplete. Far from diminishing it, this gave mathematics its most profound transcendence, for it revealed that the human quest for knowledge is infinite.

To gather sheep with stones, to solve quadratics by completing the square, to trace the path of a planet with a circle within a circle, to define rigor with $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$, to discover that truth itself will always exceed our grasp, these are not separate acts but one story. They are the human story of mathematics, rising from survival into transcendence. Al-Khwarizmi’s equations, Khayyam’s curves, Al-Tusi’s couples, Ibn al-Haytham’s rays, Peano’s axioms, Weierstrass’s limits and Gödel’s theorems are chapters in a single book we are still writing. To study mathematics is to walk this path, to trace the footprints of shepherds, philosophers and poets and to add our own. It is to glimpse, in the language of number and proof, the unending effort of a species not content to survive but always reaching beyond, seeking in the finite symbols of mathematics a reflection of the infinite.`,
