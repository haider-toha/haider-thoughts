        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">About Me</h4>
        <div className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
        <p>
  I'm a full-stack and AI engineer with an MEng in Aeronautics from Imperial College London. My background taught me to think rigorously about complex systems, blending first-principles engineering with data-driven development.
</p>
<p>
  At Goldman Sachs, I build analytics platforms and machine learning tools to scale tech risk and compliance. My work involves developing full-stack applications (React, Flask, PostgreSQL) and deploying NLP and deep learning pipelines on AWS, creating systems that cut reporting cycles from 10 days to 2 hours  and detect anomalies with 92% precision.
</p>
<p>
  Alongside this, I founded <strong>Provost Academics</strong>, an AI tutoring platform. I led the technical vision, building a RAG grading engine with 95% human-examiner agreement  and scaling the marketplace to 50+ paying clients and ¬£5k MRR.
</p>
<p>
  I will soon be joining <strong>Sammy Labs</strong> (YC W25) as a founding engineer to help build their core AI infrastructure and products from the ground up.
</p>
<p>
  I‚Äôm drawn to complex problems that involve engineering and human experience. I thrive on building technology that moves the needle, systems that are reliable, meaningful and quietly elegant in their operation.

        <div className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            Outside work, I stay active with the gym, cricket and the occasional 
            late-night walk through Hyde Park when I need to clear my head. 
            I coach my local kids football team which has been one of the most grounding things I do each week. I have also started gliding and plan to get my pilot‚Äôs license.

          </p>
          <p>
            I love to travel and explore new places. I have visited three countries this year and hope to fit in another before it ends. 
            I enjoy trying new food, learning about cultures and staying curious about the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            On quieter days, I run a small book club with friends where we read everything 
            from economics to Islamic philosophy. I also recently started journaling and Arabic calligraphy which help me slow down and stay present.
