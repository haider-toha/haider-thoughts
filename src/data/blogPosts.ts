Why should my lack of wanting be treated as a deficiency if it comes with a profound sense of sufficiency? The trouble seems to arise only when I begin to compare myself to others, or when I begin to want what I do not have. It is only at that threshold, when lack intrudes upon contentment, that restlessness and with it suffering, begins.

This question, however, is more complex than it first appears. Human traditions have long wrestled with the paradox of desire. Is desire the fire that drives growth, or the chain that binds us to perpetual dissatisfaction? The Stoics taught that true freedom lies in limiting one’s wants to what lies within one’s control. Buddhism, in its most well-known teaching, identified craving as the root of suffering. And yet, to reduce this entire discussion to the dichotomy of East and West, or to figures like Buddha and Socrates, would be to overlook a profound and deeply textured tradition within Islamic philosophy, where thinkers sought not only to critique desire but to map its anatomy.

Among these thinkers, Al-Ghazali stands out. For Al-Ghazali, the problem was never simply desire itself, but its origin and its destination. Where does my longing arise from? Toward what end does it pull me? Desire can be a ladder to transcendence or a pit that swallows us whole. The issue, then, is not to kill desire but to purify it, to transmute its energy so it ceases to serve the lower self and begins to serve the higher.

Consider, the famous encounter between Alexander the Great and Diogenes the Cynic. On the one hand stands Alexander, embodiment of conquest, power and restless striving. He personifies what Islamic thought would call the nafs al-ammārah, the commanding soul, driven by appetite and ambition without restraint. On the other hand sits Diogenes, dwelling in his barrel, embodying radical detachment from society’s norms and possessions. To many, his life appeared absurd; to him, it was freedom.

When Alexander, in his grandeur, offered to grant Diogenes any wish, Diogenes simply replied: “Stand out of my sunlight.” At first glance, this seems like a witty dismissal. But looked at more closely, it is a philosophical declaration. All of Alexander’s treasures are powerless compared to the simple gift of sunlight and the sovereign freedom of not needing anything more.

The story takes an even deeper turn when we consider Alexander’s response: “If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.” His words are not merely admiration but a recognition of something essential, what Islamic philosophy calls Fitrah, the innate and primordial nature with which every soul is created. Alexander, at the peak of worldly power, intuits the hollowness of excess and glimpses the purity of a soul unburdened.

Thinkers like Ibn Sina (Avicenna) took such stories not as curiosities but as windows into the spectrum of the soul. For him, Alexander and Diogenes are not two options to be chosen between, but two poles on a continuum of possibility. The task of the human being is not to side with one extreme or carve out a lazy compromise, but to undergo a process of transformation. This process is Tazkiyah, purification of the self, by which raw desire is refined into its truest form. The guiding question, then, is not “How much should I desire?” but “What is the nature of my desire and does it align with my highest self?”

It is here that the notion of low desire becomes more nuanced. For Islamic thinkers, low desire is not in itself good or bad. It must be diagnosed. Early spiritual masters like Al-Muhasibi placed enormous emphasis on muhasaba, the inner audit of one’s intentions and actions. Through this lens, a state of diminished wanting can signify either the pinnacle of spiritual achievement or the depths of spiritual collapse.

For some, low desire reflects Qanā‘ah, or contentment. This is not passive apathy but an active, mature serenity. It is the fruit of struggle, the calm after wrestling with the self and with the illusions of the world. The person of Qanā‘ah is like Diogenes in his barrel, but with a crucial difference. Their peace is not a philosophical posture but a spiritual victory. They have not merely renounced; they have reconciled. They rest in the decree of God, their heart unperturbed. To demand more desire from such a soul is to misunderstand them entirely; their quiet is not emptiness but fullness.

For others, however, low desire signals a very different reality. It may arise from kasal (sloth), jubn (cowardice), or sheer despair. This is the artist who never paints, not because she has transcended ambition but because she fears failure. This is the would-be leader who never speaks, not out of humility but out of self-doubt. Here, low desire is a prison. The Persian poet Rumi warns against this false quiet. It is not peace but betrayal, the silencing of the soul’s call. In such a state, the soul suffers not because it craves too much, but because it denies its own God-given potential, its Fitrah.

The contrast is striking. Two people may appear equally unambitious, equally detached, equally at rest. Yet one has climbed the mountain of the self and arrived at serenity, while the other has fled the climb altogether. One silence is victory; the other is avoidance. One is like the quiet after a just war is won. The other is like the stillness of a desert that has turned away the rain.

So, is low desire a problem? Islamic philosophy resists the simplicity of a yes or no. It offers instead a mirror, a diagnostic tool, an invitation to radical honesty. The questions it poses are:

- Is my lack of desire the fruit of Qanā‘ah, or the rot of kasal?

- Has my soul subdued the nafs al-ammārah in service of a higher purpose, or has it simply gone numb?

- Am I aligned with my highest nature, or am I betraying it?

The conclusion is subtle yet profound. The problem is never the quantity of desire but its quality and orientation. Desire is like water. In one form, it nourishes, purifies and sustains life. In another, it floods, drowns and destroys. The task is not to drain the river but to channel it.

Thus, the question of desire becomes not merely psychological but spiritual. The challenge is to discern which quiet we are living in; is it the quiet of fulfillment, or the quiet of neglect.`,
